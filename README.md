📊 Analyzing Healthcare Data in Power BI
🩺 Case Study: Hospital Discharges Analysis - New York State

📁 Project Description

This Power BI dashboard project presents an in-depth analysis of hospital discharge data from healthcare facilities across New York State. It utilizes a rich dataset containing detailed information about patient demographics, clinical procedures, diagnoses, hospital performance, and resource utilization metrics. The purpose of this case study is to uncover patterns and key influencers that affect hospital length of stay (LOS) and cost per discharge, helping healthcare administrators, analysts, and policymakers make informed decisions.


📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
1. Average Length of Stay (LOS) by Hospital
Average LOS across hospitals is 2.65 days.

Kings County Hospital Center, Interfaith Medical Center, and Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases have the highest LOS, reaching up to 12 days.

The lowest LOS (<2 days) was observed in Northern Dutchess Hospital, St. Elizabeth Medical Center, and Alice Hyde Medical Center.

2. Average Cost per Discharge
The overall average cost per discharge is $20,910.

Highest-cost hospitals include NYU Lutheran Medical Center ($85K) and Olean General Hospital.

Lowest-cost facilities are located in Southern Tier and Capital/Adirondack regions, such as Newark-Wayne Community Hospital.

3. Top Influencers on LOS
LOS significantly increases when:

apr_severity_of_illness_description is Extreme

apr_risk_of_mortality is Major or Extreme

health_service_area is New York City

patient_disposition is Skilled Nursing Facility

4. Most Common Diagnoses
Osteoarthritis and Complication of orthopedic device account for over 89% of discharges in orthopedic-focused hospitals.

5. Disposition Patterns
Majority of patients are discharged to:

Home/self-care (73%)

Home with home health services (10%)

Skilled Nursing Facilities (4.3%)

🧠 Business Applications
Hospital Benchmarking: Identify outliers with higher-than-average LOS or cost.

Resource Optimization: Target hospitals and patient profiles where extended stays can be mitigated.

Policy Support: Guide healthcare planning for post-discharge care services.
